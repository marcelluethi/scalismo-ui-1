/**
 * Interaction strategy.
 * An interaction strategy gets notified about events before they are passed to the rendering implementation.
 * This can be used for building complicated interaction state machines, as well as to selectively block events
 * from reaching the rendering implementation.
 *
 * Interactors are made active by using the [[scalismo.ui.view.ScalismoFrame.interactor]] setter.
 *
 * They are invoked from the [[scalismo.ui.rendering.internal.EventInterceptor]] class, and if the verdict is to
 * pass on the event, it is handled by an [[scalismo.ui.rendering.internal.InteractorForwarder]], ultimately reaching
 * the [[scalismo.ui.rendering.internal.RenderWindowInteractor]] in the rendering implementation.
 *
 * The above paragraph was to explain how things work, but also to provide quick links for navigating to the relevant classes :-)
 *
 *
 * The UI comes with a couple of predefined recipes, defined in the [[Recipe]] class, as well as traits which combine recipes
 * into fully-usable "behavior bundles". When mixing in these traits, the order may be important. Roughly speaking, traits
 * further to the right take effect first. When you call a method on a class with mixins, the method in the trait furthest
 * to the right is called first. If that method calls super, it invokes the method in the next trait to its left, and so on.
 *
 * Mixins are useful, but have to be handled with care. Don't overdo it. If in doubt, manually combine recipes instead.
