/**
 * This class is in a bit of an awkward position, as it conceptually sits
 * somewhere between the model and the view. Essentially, it controls
 * properties of a scene, in a particular view. Such things can't go
 * inside the model package -- because a scene does not know anything about
 * frames etc. But they don't really belong into the view package either,
 * because that one contains Swing implementations. So for now, there's the
 * control package.
