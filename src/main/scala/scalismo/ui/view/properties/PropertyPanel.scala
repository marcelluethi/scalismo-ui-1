   *
   * The general contract is that on invocation, an implementation cleans up any current
   * state first, then decides whether it can provide a useful UI for *all* of the nodes.
   * If that is the case, then it should prepare its UI accordingly, and return true. If
   * not, then it simply returns false. In other words: the value that is returned here
   * is used to determine whether this Panel is active (usable) for the current set of
   * selected nodes. If it's not, then it won't be shown, but if it is, then it has to
   * be in a usable state upon return.
   *
   * It is generally recommended to use the [[allMatch]] method in implementations, which
   * offers a type-safe and convenient way to make decisions about whether a non-empty list of
   * supported nodes was provided.
   *
   * @param nodes list of selected nodes.
   * @return true if this panel can handle the provided nodes, false otherwise.
